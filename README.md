This is a modern port of the **Multiverse** template from HTML5 UP, converted into an [Astro](https://astro.build) project. It retains the slick, one-page gallery design and custom panel system while leveraging Astro's component-based architecture and optimized build pipeline.

## Features (Astro Port)

- **Lightweight Logic**: jQuery has been removed and replaced with [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev) for state management and interactivity.
- **Component-Based**: Modularized into `Header`, `Footer`, `Gallery`, and `GalleryItem` Astro components.
- **Data-Driven Gallery**: Gallery items are managed via a simple array in `Gallery.astro`, making it easy to add or remove images.
- **Optimized Sass**: Modern SCSS structure using component-scoped styles within `.astro` files. Legacy `vendor()` mixins and manual prefixing have been removed in favor of standard CSS and modern build tools.
- **Unified Design System**: A centralized `libs` module provides shared variables, functions, and mixins across all components via a clean `@import '../styles/libs';` interface.
- **Lightbox**: Fully functional PhotoSwipe lightbox integrated into the `Gallery` component.
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first design with synchronized breakpoints between CSS and JS.

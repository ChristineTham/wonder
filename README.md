This is a modern port of the **Multiverse** template from HTML5 UP, converted into an [Astro](https://astro.build) project. It retains the slick, one-page gallery design and custom panel system while leveraging Astro's component-based architecture and optimized build pipeline.

## Features (Astro Port)

- **Component-Based**: Modularized into `Header`, `Footer`, `Gallery`, and `GalleryItem` Astro components.
- **Data-Driven Gallery**: Gallery items are managed via a simple array in `Gallery.astro`, making it easy to add or remove images.
- **Sass Integration**: Built-in SCSS support with modular stylesheets in `src/styles/`.
- **Lightbox**: Fully functional Poptrox lightbox (jQuery-based) loaded via `public/js/`.
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first design with synchronized breakpoints between CSS and JS.
